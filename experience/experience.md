# CKA Exam Experience

My PSI environment experience was pretty smooth. I believe they've taken care of the issues we see on the internet. 

## 1. Environment

Google Chrome (K8 documentation)
Ctrl + C (copy) 

In Terminal: 
Ctrl + shift + c (copy) 
Ctrl + shift + v (paste)

Got 17 questions with mix difficulty at random order.
