# CKA Exam Experience

My PSI environment experience was pretty smooth. I believe they've taken care of the issues we see on the internet. 

So, I started preparing for CKA on 16th December the day I passed my AWS DevOps Eng. - Professional. I studied and practiced everyday. Last 2 weeks before exam I just did exam mode practice. So, that's about 2 & half months. 

## 1. Environment

I finished couple of minutes earlier and spent good amount of time troubleshooting couple of questions. If you do enough practice I belive time is enough.

In exam I was given links to K8 documentation for each question. 
link opens in Google Chrome (K8 documentation)
Ctrl + C (copy) from Google Chrome 

In Terminal: 
Ctrl + shift + c (copy) 
Ctrl + shift + v (paste)

Got 17 questions with mix difficulty at random order.

(Got my result passed by 79 Marks - Got my result within 24 hours.)
