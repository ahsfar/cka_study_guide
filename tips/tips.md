# CKA Exam Tips
(Will udpate more after the exam)
Following or some helpful tips I've noticed while preparing for CKA Exam.

## 1. Fundamentals

Master the core concepts of Kubernetes (architecture and concepts such as Pods, Deployments, Services, Networking, Storage, and Security). Better understanding really helps in troubleshooting faster. Troubleshoting takes the highest percentage for the exam.

## 2. Familiarity with Documentation

Since we can use official documentation for the exam make sure to go through it and see what can you find where. (Practice navigating info.)

## 3. Imperative is the way to go

Use imperative commands wherever you can to save time and dry-run into yaml format and edit if needed.

## 4 Mock Exam

This is very important if you are not working professionally with K8's.
- Practice as much as possible (Time yourself)
- When you book exam you get killer.sh two sessions that's very similar to actual exam format. (It's generally harder than real exam)
