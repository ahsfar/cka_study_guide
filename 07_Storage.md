# Storage

Storage driver: ZFS, AUFS, etc based on OS -> Volume mount and bind mount.
Volume driver: local or external (AWs_ebs, or other cloud providers)(if container is killed volume is safe)

CRI: container runtime interface -> for docker, cri-o, rocket etc
CNI: Container Network Interface -> weaveworks, flannel, etc
CSI: Container Storage Interface -> GlusterFS, aws ebs, etc

In Kubernetes you can create volumes on host or external and mount them to your pods.
